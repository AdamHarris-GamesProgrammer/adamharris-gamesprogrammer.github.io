<p>Roach Collector is a Third Person Shooter with Rogue-Like elements built in Unity 2020 for a university module where I had to work in a team to develop a game over the course of a semester. Roach Collector is based in a post-apocalyptic world where you have to go from location to location taking down the leader of that camp, each level had a focus on openness that allowed the player to take multiple paths through each level where each path would have different; loot, enemies and challenges. </p>
<p>Built in Unity 2020.1.14f1</p>
<p>Built in 6 months</p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <li>Save System: Roach Collector features a save system based on the .NET serialization system, this means that each saveable object in a level will added to the players save file and there status could be saved and loaded depending on what they were, for example the black market would save what guns and armour were already bought, the inventory system was also baked into the saving system to allow the player to come in and out of each level with their loot.</li>

      </div>
      <div>
        <li>Utility Theory-based Finite State Machine (FSM): Each enemy AI in the game would act based on a FSM, this allows them to switch between states in a managed way, however for the combat systems where there are many actions that would be worthwhile such as; taking cover, shooting at the player, calling for backup, or retreating. A Utility theory system was produced where each action would be evaluated as to how useful it is and then the AI would take that action. </li>
