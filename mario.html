							<h2>About</h2>

							<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p>This project was created as part of my Game Engine Creation module for my university coure. This game served as my first full game project that
							I made from scratch as opposed to using a prebuilt game engine such as Unity or Unreal, this made it quite a challenge for me as I had to learn a lot 
							of new concepts such as Game Engine Architecture and game design. A large focus of this project for me was creating a easy to expand upon framework for
							developing tilemap based 2D games, therefore I wrote a lot of modular code which added additional complexity to the project. The result of this was a 
							almost fully fledged 2D game engine which handles level loading, audio, rendering, character movements, and animations in easy to use systems.
							</p>

							<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>C++ </h3>
									<p>This project was based in C++11, this language was chosen as it allows me to have a lot of control over memory and optimising my code beyond what I would be able to accomplish
									with other object oriented based programming languages such as C#</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-gem"></span>
									<h3>Source Control using GitHub</h3>
									<p>I used GitHub to act as my source control system for this project, this project was transferred from home and to university a lot meaning
									that I had to make use of source control to keep a singular version between devices.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>SDL2</h3>
									<p>I used SDL2 as the graphics library for this project as it allowed me to focus on learning the aspects of creating game systems as opposed to learning how to use OpenGL for a full fledged game.</p>
								</section>

									<h3>Tile Mapping</h3>
									<p>I make use of tile maps for this game, this allowed me to quickly create levels that allowed for rapid development and testing of individual features. To create these tilemaps I utilised a program called Tiled</p>
